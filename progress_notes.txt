Total Project Hours (6/4/2025 - ?)

Notes:
6/4/2025: Found basic code layout through google search. Copied into main.py to determine how it works. While functional, it
won't work as more than a skeleton for my end goals. When running the program, it prints out the round number, the list of 
combatants with their initiative, a pointer to indicate whose turn it is, and a prompt for the user to press the enter key to
advance the turn. However, when pressing enter, the program simply reprints the entire list and moves the pointer to the next
combatant in the order. This is not how I want my version to function. I only want to print the list out once when the program
is first started. After that, I only want to print out "It is insert-combatant-name's turn." each time the trigger is given.
I'll have to find a way around this, but I think this will provide a decent basis to work from.
Goals:
-Remove round counter to simplify.
-Modify code so that it only prints current combatant's turn when advancing.
Intended Order of Operations
1. Enter combatants
2. Program sorts combatants by initiative in descending order, then sorts them into a list of allies and a list of enemies.
3. Program displays initiative order in terminal.
4. Program displays first turn ("It is Conan, the Librarian's turn!") and waits for further input.
5. Upon input given to advance turn, index advances to next combatant in order and repeats step 4 for that combatant.
6. Upon input given to remove combatant from combat, program removes them from the initiative list and corresponding ally or
enemies list, advances to next combatant in list and repeats step 4 for them.
7. Once the end of initiative order has been reached, input to advance the turn will return to the first available/living 
combatant in the initiative order. If at any point the allies or enemies list is empty, the program prints a message to the
console stating "All allies/enemies have been slain!"
