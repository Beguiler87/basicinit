Total Project Hours (6/4/2025 - ?)
4.5
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Notes:
6/4/2025: Found basic code layout through google search. Copied into main.py to determine how it works. While functional, it
won't work as more than a skeleton for my end goals. When running the program, it prints out the round number, the list of 
combatants with their initiative, a pointer to indicate whose turn it is, and a prompt for the user to press the enter key to
advance the turn. However, when pressing enter, the program simply reprints the entire list and moves the pointer to the next
combatant in the order. This is not how I want my version to function. I only want to print the list out once when the program
is first started. After that, I only want to print out "It is insert-combatant-name's turn." each time the trigger is given.
I'll have to find a way around this, but I think this will provide a decent basis to work from.
Goals:
-Remove round counter to simplify.
-Modify code so that it only prints current combatant's turn when advancing.
Intended Order of Operations
1. Enter combatants
2. Program sorts combatants by initiative in descending order, then sorts them into a list of allies and a list of enemies.
3. Program displays initiative order in terminal.
4. Program displays first turn ("It is Conan, the Librarian's turn!") and waits for further input.
5. Upon input given to advance turn, index advances to next combatant in order and repeats step 4 for that combatant.
6. Upon input given to remove combatant from combat, program removes them from the initiative list and corresponding ally or
enemies list, advances to next combatant in list and repeats step 4 for them.
7. Once the end of initiative order has been reached, input to advance the turn will return to the first available/living 
combatant in the initiative order. If at any point the allies or enemies list is empty, the program prints a message to the
console stating "All allies/enemies have been slain!"

6/5/2025: Started on basic layout today. Used skeletal structure of example code for bulk of project, changing naming
conventions to fit my own taste. Added sorting into ally/enemy lists. Did some googling and worked with ChatGPT for the first
time. Not what I really wanted to do, but it works as a tool. I'm struggling to get the system to do what I want. Maybe I need
to slow down and work on smaller chunks?
That approach seems to be working. The basic structure is working the way I want it to. The system initializes, displays all
of the combatants, their allegiance, and initiatives, then indicates the first turn and prompts for the next turn. Now to
figure out how to remove a combatant on triggers. That should be interesting.
Despite my initial distrust of ChatGPT, it seems to be at least a somewhat useful tool. Regarding everything that comes out of
it, I'll have to remember the old adage "Trust, but verify."
Ok, significant progress made. The system is functioning well so far. It completes all of the steps mentioned previously, as
well as now removing slain combatants from the initiative order when the command 'slain' is entered. As an unintended bonus,
the system also prints a message when all combatants have been removed. I don't intend that this should happen very often
since it's unlikely that all combatants will be removed from combat.
That being said, I may be adding more to this project than initially intended. I'd like to approach that 20 hour minimum if I
can, since this is going so quickly. I'll have to think about that.

6/6/2025: I'm starting to feel a bit like Victor Frankenstein("It's ALIVE!") and a bit of impostor syndrome. This has come
much further, much more quickly, than I had initially expected. I'm not sure if that's a good thing or a bad. The initiative
tracker is pretty much where I had initially intended it to be, but I'm not anywhere near that 20 hour mark yet. I'll have to
add more stuff...
