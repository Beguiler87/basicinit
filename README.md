# basicinit
A basic initiative tracker for TTRPGs
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This tool is intended to keep track of combat initiative for GMs running TTRPGs.
Once a list of combatants is entered, the system will display those combatants in initiative order, from highest to lowest.
Keyboard commands will enable the user to advance the initiative as participants complete their turns, and remove participants
who are no longer part of the initiative (ie, They're dead, Jim.).

Cloning Instructions (ie, How do I get this on my own machine?)
Open the terminal you intend to use to run this program. It was created using VS Code, but that shouldn't make a difference as
far as users are concerned. Open the directory where you would like to clone to. Once you have done so, in your terminal, type
git clone https://github.com/Beguiler87/basicinit, and press enter. If you run into issues, I suggest reviewing GitHub's
cloning instructions at https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository.

Potential updates to this tool in future projects...
-MAKE COPY OF ALL FILES ONCE PROJECT IS COMPLETE!
